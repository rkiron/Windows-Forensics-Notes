# Windows Forensics Notes

This repository is my structured knowledge base for **Windows Forensics**, focused on:

- DFIR fundamentals  
- Windows artifact mastery  
- CTF-style forensic challenges  
- Fast investigation workflows  

This is not a collection of random notes.  
This repo is built as a **forensic reference system + training ground + long-term portfolio.**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Master Windows internals and forensic artifacts  
- Build investigation methodologies that scale from CTFs to real incidents  
- Develop fast triage and timeline reconstruction skills  
- Maintain a continuously evolving forensic playbook

## 🧠 How this repository is organized

00-Methodology/ → How investigations are conducted  
01-Windows-Internals/ → How Windows works internally  
02-Artifacts/ → What evidence Windows leaves behind  
03-Tools/ → How artifacts are extracted and analyzed  
04-Techniques/ → How evidence is correlated into conclusions  
05-CTF-Notes/ → How Windows forensics appears in competitions  
06-Case-Studies/ → Hands-on labs, simulations, and writeups  
07-Cheatsheets/ → Fast-reference material and maps


Each note is written to answer at least one of:

- What is this artifact/component?
- Where is it located?
- What forensic questions does it answer?
- How is it used in investigations and CTFs?
- How do I extract and interpret it quickly?

If a note doesn’t serve those purposes, it gets rewritten.
